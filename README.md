# *ðŸŽ¹ Piano Keys*

*Is an interactive project that allows users to play a melody by clicking on virtual piano keys, while following step-by-step instructions through progression buttons in a song box.*

## *Main Features*

- ***Interactive Keys*** *: Each piano key changes color when pressed (`mousedown`) and returns to its original color when released (`mouseup`).*
- ***Song Tracking*** *: The song box displays the lyrics and notes of *Happy Birthday* and updates as the user progresses through the song.*
- ***Guided Progression*** *: Progression buttons (nextOne, nextTwo, nextThree, startOver) allow users to move through each stage of the song.*
- ***Responsive Events*** *: Interactions with the piano keys and song box are managed by `DOM events`, modifying the lyrics and notes display based on user actions.*

## *How to Use*

1. ***Play Notes*** *: Click on the piano keys to change their color and hear the corresponding notes.*
2. ***Follow the Progression*** *: Use the progression buttons in the song box to advance through the song and follow each step.*

## *Technologies Used*

- ***HTML & CSS*** *: For structure and styling.*
- ***JavaScript*** *: For interaction logic and event handling.*

## *JavaScript Events and Methods*

- ***Events*** *: `mousedown`, `mouseup`, `click`.*
- ***Methods*** *: `addEventListener`, `.forEach`, `.textContent`, `.hidden`, `.style.display`.*
